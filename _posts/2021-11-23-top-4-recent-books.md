1. The Splendid and The Vile, By Erik Larson
> On Winston Churchill’s first day as prime minister, Adolf Hitler 
> invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already 
> fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. 
> For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, 
> killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his 
> country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that 
> Britain was a worthy ally—and willing to fight to the end.

2. The Handmaid's Tale, by Margaret Atwood
> The Handmaid's Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will 
> be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near 
> future, it describes life in what was once the United States and 
> is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted 
> to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, 
> and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans.
> The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with
> bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population.

3. No Longer Human, by Osamu Dazai
> The poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between
> the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic
> family and the impact of Western ideas. Portraying himself as a failure,
> the protagonist of Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human narrates a seemingly 
> normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human 
> beings. Oba Yozo's attempts to reconcile himself to the world around 
> him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where 
> he becomes a "clown" to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a 
> failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records 
> the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection 
> and tenderness.

4. The Road, by Cormac McCarthy
> By the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, Cormac McCarthy's The Road 
> is the story of a father and son walking alone through burned America,
