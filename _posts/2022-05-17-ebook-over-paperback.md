1. **The font size is adjustable.**
    
    Even with glasses, I often find that the print size in a book is too small
    to read from a comfortable distance. Using an eReader, the font size can be 
    adjusted to whatever suits me best.

2. **The screen brightness is adjustable.**

    Makes it easy to read at night without an external light source. 
    In addition, my eReader, the Kobo Clara HD, contains a setting to
    adjust the natural light which can reduce the amount of blue light
    exposure at night.

3. **Conveniently look up the definition of a word.**

    Highlight a word to easily look up its meaning rather than pulling out a 
    separate device.

4. **Find previous references to a character, place, etc.**

    Especially when returning to a book after a hiatus,
    I may encounter a character's name or place that I don't remember.
    Highlighting the word and selecting "Search in book" pulls up all other references
    to the same word within the book, allowing me to jump to previous references in order to
    regain context.

5. **Direct access to free eBooks via the public library system.**

    I'm able to connect my eReader to [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) 
    where I can access the electronic collection of a couple public libraries
    which I belong to, including the Brooklyn Library ([available](https://disc.bklynlibrary.org/card/) to out of state 
    residents for $50 / month). Then, I can checkout a book and start reading
    in minutes, without even leaving my home.
